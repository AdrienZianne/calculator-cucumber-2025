The memory principle is the same as in the normal calculator.
The =, AC... buttons are also the same. 
Here are the functionalities you can find on this calculator.<br><br>

randi (rand_int), randre (rand_real), randra (rand_ratio) and randc (rand_cmplx) are respectively random generators. 
randi takes one argument, which is the maximum value of the generated integer.
randre and randc take no arguments.
randra takes two arguments, the maximum value of the first number and the second.<br><br>

You can also perform conversions by using conv to transform to different bases (for example, base 2).<br><br>

Logical operations are possible with not, and, impl...<br><br>

equiv is used to check whether two values are equivalent (returns 1 or 0).<br><br>

rs, ls are used for shifts and conv is used to convert to different bases. <br><br>

radtodeg and degtorad are used to convert degrees into radians and vice versa.
