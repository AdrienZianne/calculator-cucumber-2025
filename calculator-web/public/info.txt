Hello and welcome to the Calculator-cucumber ! <br><br>

You can use your keyboard for simple operations (numbers, (), /, +, *, -, ...) 
or the one provided by the application (in particular for cos, tan,...).<br><br>

If you're using your computer's keyboard, special operations like cos are therefore 
performed by enlarging the application's keyboard. You can click Enter when 
your calculation is complete or click on '=' if you use the application keyboard.<br><br>

The “_____” button is used to add a space.
AC deletes your entire calculation, and the arrows allow you to move in your calculation.<br><br>

When you make a calculation and submit it, you'll see a memory system. 
You can delete a specific line from this memory, or delete everything. 
The memory automatically deletes the first calculation made in the list when it exceeds a size of 5.<br><br>

randi, randre, randra and randc are respectively random generators. 
randi takes one argument, which is the maximum value of the generated integer.
randre and randc take no arguments.
randra takes two arguments, the maximum value of the first number and the second.<br><br>

You can also perform basic conversions using _2,_8,_16, for example.<br><br>

Logical operations are possible with not, and (&), impl...<br><br>

equiv is used to check whether two values are equivalent (returns 1 or 0).<br><br>

<,>, rs, ls are used for offsets and conv is used to convert to different bases.
